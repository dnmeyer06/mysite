<!-- Location: If you don't know how to get here already, you're not cool enough.
Contact Info: Search for a busker reciting the 32nd page of Bukowskis "Love Is a Dog from Hell". Ask him "where does the cat sip the saucer?", he will give you a folded peice of paper; DO NOT OPEN IT, until you have rounded the corner. There will be an address, go there and wait out front. A small child will come by and try to sell you a flower, buy 4 and follow the child down the back alley. Scrawled on the lefthand wall will be a number to a PO box. Go there and leave a haiku requesting the contact info with your address. A carrier pigeon will deliver a letter with an address. Go there and leave your question in the mailbox. Come back on the second full moon following the thrid fort-night and a resopnse will be waiting. -->
