    <p>Please note, the projects pictured on this page are not mine, but are creations of the partner company, 36Creative</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In our partnership with 36Creative, they tasked us with researching what startups looked for in a creative agency and creating landing pages to directly target this demographic.</li> 
      <li>I took assets and styles from their website in order to accurately ape their style.</li>
      <li>Design and aesthetics are credited to 36creative, but I am happy with my ability to recreate their style and adhere to their brand guide.</li>
