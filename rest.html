     <h1>What is "reclaimed food?"</h1>
     <h1>What is our menu?</h1>
     <h1> The answer to the first question, will provide an answer to the second.</h1>
     <p>Do you know how much food is thrown away every day in the United States? Do you?!?! Seriously, do you? A statistic would be really compelling here. But it's a butt-ton, that's for sure. For that reason our head chef and founder, Rupert, has poineered the concept of "reclaimed food." Every meal that you consume at Pretension will included at least 20% food that has been recovered from the refuse heap. You can feel superior in your knowledge that your food would have gone to waste. While some may winge at "health-code violations" and "infection from exposure to waste", we know that you have thrown off such square notions and will fully embrace the culinary venture that you are about to embark upon.</p>

Between then and your meal, we will take that cow and provide it the most delightful, frolicking, cow fulfilling day that will leave it in a state of utter euphoria. When the time comes, the mixture of emotions in the cow will provide the most succulent taste to your burger</p>

Go there and leave a haiku requesting the contact info with your address. A carrier pigeon will deliver a letter with an address. Go there and leave your question in the mailbox.

          <br>
          <br>Your reality?

          <br>Yes... yes it can.
          <br>
          <br>After studying culinary preparation at L'atelier des Chefs in Paris, Rupert chaffed at the the bourgeois upper class food prep they thought which he felt was distracting him from the authentic, real world nature of food preparation. For this reason, he left his school in France and got a job clubbing rats for stew in Waynesboro, Mississippi. From his connection with the common man,
